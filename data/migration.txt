Migration Notes

JNet implements most of J6 wd commands with
differences as summarized below.

== JNET
   noun IFJNET_z_ set to 1 by jnet.exe
   wd'qwd'  returns 'jwin32' on both Windows and Linux
   wd'qwd2' returns 'jnet'

== jnet.exe
   3 versions: anycpu, x64 and x86.
   anycpu is recommended
   x64 and x86 only run on Intel/AMD cpu
   x64 and x86 for running JEXEServer com interop
   x86 is needed for running J32 on 64-bit platforms

== com automation server
   progid: JEXEServerLib.JEXEServer
   register: jnet.exe /regserver
   unregister: jnet.exe /unregserver

== opengl
   new opengl control that supports both legacy and modern opengl

== project manager
   both J6 and J8 project managers supported
   J8 project manager is the default and recommanded

== new child classes
   checkedlistbox datepicker dspinbox editint editmask
   editnum image isidraw isiprint opengl progressbar spinbox
   timepicker webview

== new wd commands
   end get getj getp ide immexj NB.
   qfontdef qform qosver qwd2
   setc setj setp verbose version xy wh maxwh minwh
   bin and other related commands are accepted but ignored

   for creategroup id
   setselect id n  to switch and show tabpage if id is a tab

   readimg      11!:3000  (jnet locale)
   getimg       11!:3001
   writeimg     11!:3002
   putimg       11!:3003
   clippasteimg 11!:3004
   clipcopyimg  11!:3005

== un-implemented wd commands
   setpclip wait
   oledlg oleload olemethodx olerelease olesave

== incompatible changes

=== pc6j and pc8j
   both of them create new parent forms
   pc8j J8 compatible
     dialog unit = pixel
     set id property ...
   pc6j J6 compatible
     dialog unit = 2 x pixel
     set id ...   (default property)
   pc interpreted as pc6j or pc8j depending on legacy option (see below)

   setc id property ...  (works in both pc and pc6j)

=== isigraph
   isigraph default to no double buffering, use glnodblbuf to change
   glclear does not paint white background, use glfill to change
   glpixels and glqpixels data with alpha channel
   legacy oldisigraph option to change restore old behavior

=== gl2 printing
   use isiprint instead of isigraph
   default or with j8 style:
     printer graphic unit in 1/100 inch
     devmode w,h in 1/100 inch
   legacy twip mode or with j6 style:
     printer graphic unit in twip
     devmode w,h in 0.1 mm

=== mb commands
   the syntax for messages is:
     wd 'mb type [defbutton] buttons title message'

   type specifies the icon and default behaviour:
    msg title text [style...]
    about
    info      (default OK button)
    warn      (default OK button)
    critical  (default OK button)
    query     (requires two or three buttons)

   if one button, there is no result,
   otherwise the result is the button name (ok, cancel, ...)

   buttons are from the set, defbutton {} is the default:
    mb_abortretryignore contains Abort, Retry, and Ignore buttons.
    mb_ok               contains an OK button.
    mb_okcancel         contains OK and Cancel buttons.
    mb_retrycancel      contains Retry and Cancel buttons.
    mb_yesno            contains Yes and No buttons.
    mb_yesnocancel      contains Yes, No, and Cancel buttons.

   defbutton if present is either
    mb_defbutton1,  mb_defbutton2,  mb_defbutton3

   Other commands
     mb dir title directory
     mb open1 title directory [filters]       (return 1 file)
     mb open needs title directory [filters]  (return list of files)
     mb save title directory [filters]
     mb font [title] font size
     mb color [R G B]
     mb printer [pd_pagesetup]   NB. pd_printsetup ignored
        Unlike J6's win32 pd_printsetup, the pd_pagesetup only displays
        a page setup dialog, no printer selection can be done.

   emulate J6
     mb open6 title directory filename [filters] [style...] (style ignored)
     mb save6 title directory filename [filters] [style...] (style ignored)

   the "mb_" and "mb_icon" prefix are optional


=== legacy options
   options for better J6 compatibility however they are J8 INCOMPATIBLE
   all options are initially set to false

     wd 'setj pc6j [bool]'
     if enabled, 'pc ...' interpreted as 'pc6j ...'

     wd 'setj twip [bool]'
     set printer graphic unit to twip and devmode in 0.1 mm

     wd 'setj mb [bool]'
     mbopen,mbsave,mb interpreted as mbopen6,mbsave6,mbmsg

     wd 'setj oldisigraph [bool]'
     new isigraph default double buffering, white background
     glpixels and glqpixels ignore alpha channel for them

== syntax coloring
   no effect on Linux except text and background color
   Color scheme set in Edit|configure|Color
   known issue in font with underline
   smkeywords changed:
     wd'smkeywords 0 [0/1]'   enable syntax coloring
     wd'smkeywords 1 [0/1]'   enable syntax coloring in Term
     wd'smkeywords 2 [0/1]'   enable unmatched parenthesis
     other smkeywords options are ignored
