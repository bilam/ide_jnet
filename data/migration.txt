   pc6j J602 compatible
     dialog unit = 2 x pixel
     set id ...   (default property)

    info      (default OK button)
    warn      (default OK button)
    critical  (default OK button)
    query     (requires two or three buttons)

   if one button, there is no result,
   otherwise the result is the button name (ok, cancel, ...)

   buttons are from the set, defbutton {} is the default:
    mb_abortretryignore contains Abort, Retry, and Ignore buttons.
